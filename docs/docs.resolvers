Resolvers provide the instructions for turning a GraphQL operation (a query, mutation, or subscription) into data.
They return the same shape of data we specify in our schema -- either synchronously or as a promise that resolves to a result of that shape.
Typically, you create a resolver map manually.
The @nestjs/graphql package, on the other hand, generates a resolver map automatically using the metadata provided by decorators you use to annotate classes.
